# Writeup

## Project Overview
Our project, MBTA Helper, is a website that returns the nearest MBTA station when an address is entered. It consists of two python files (one implementing Flask, another defining all our functions to find locational data) and three html files (one form page, one results page, one error page). Our Flask python file takes the index html file as an input and runs the functions in our mbta_helper python file and utilizes the results and error html files as outputs. In addition to the basic requirements we utilized a bit of CSS when implementing the error.html page. 

## Project Reflection
Our understanding of our project requirements and outcome was clear. We were also able to divide our work and code collaboratively.
